# T1136 ‚Äì Create Account (Atomic Red Team)

**MITRE Technique**: [T1136 ‚Äì Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/)

This technique tests adversarial behavior where new local or domain accounts are created, often to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

---

## üéØ Description

We simulate the creation of a new local user account using Atomic Red Team. This mirrors real-world behavior where threat actors create backdoor accounts during post-exploitation.

### Atomic Command Used:

```powershell
net user eviluser Passw0rd! /add
```

This creates a local user account named `eviluser` with the specified password.

## üîç Detection in Splunk

### Tools Involved:

* Sysmon configured to monitor user creation events (Event ID 4720)
* Splunk Universal Forwarder forwarding logs to Splunk
* Windows Event Logs enabled for account management

### Detection Method:

* Event ID 4720 logs creation of user accounts
* Logs forwarded to Splunk and indexed under `WinEventLog:Security`

### Splunk Detection Query:

```splunk
index=endpoint sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4720
| table _time, TargetUserName, SubjectUserName, ComputerName
```

### What to Look For:

* Unexpected new accounts
* Accounts created by uncommon user accounts (e.g., not a sysadmin)
* Accounts created outside of business hours

---

## ‚úÖ Result

* The user creation was logged and confirmed by Event ID 4720.
* Splunk displayed the exact user creation with timestamp and source.
* A red team analyst could easily verify successful account creation.
