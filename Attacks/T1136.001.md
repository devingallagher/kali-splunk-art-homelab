# T1136 ‚Äì Create Account (Atomic Red Team)

**MITRE Technique**: [T1136 ‚Äì Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/)

This technique tests adversarial behavior where new local or domain accounts are created, often to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

---

## üéØ Description

We simulate the creation of a new local user account using Atomic Red Team. This mirrors real-world behavior where threat actors create backdoor accounts during post-exploitation.

### Atomic Command Used:

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001
```

This command launches an ART simulation that attempts to create a new user via PowerShell and validate detection.

## üîç Detection in Splunk

### Tools Involved:

* Sysmon configured to monitor user creation events (Event ID 4720)
* Splunk Universal Forwarder forwarding logs to Splunk
* Windows Event Logs enabled for account management

### Detection Method:

* Event ID 4720 logs creation of user accounts
* Logs forwarded to Splunk and indexed under `WinEventLog:Security`

### Splunk Detection Query:

```splunk
index=endpoint sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4720
| table _time, TargetUserName, SubjectUserName, ComputerName
```

### What to Look For:

* Unexpected new accounts
* Accounts created by uncommon user accounts (e.g., not a sysadmin)
* Accounts created outside of business hours

---

## ‚úÖ Result

* The user creation appeared to succeed locally but was not logged by Splunk.
* Indicates a detection gap for T1136.001 execution.
* Splunk showed no event logs confirming the account creation, exposing a visibility blindspot.
